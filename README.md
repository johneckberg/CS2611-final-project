# CS2611-final-project
Current focus for week 14 is:
1. loading and cleaning the data into a dataframe
2. training inital Bert model with classification head from huggingface
3. Document the baseline model's performance and create a short writeup (~1
page) of the work that has been completed thus far.

Focus for week 15:
1. Improve model via increased batch size (will have to do some data parallelism) and potentially choosing a different base bert model
2. train up classical model
3. Report
