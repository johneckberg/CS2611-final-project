# BERT-based Tweet Sentiment Extraction
## CS2611-final-project: DJ & John

## Project Overview
Text sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing technique where text is analyzed and labeled
against a set of criteria. 
The objective of this project was to create a model that could accurately predict the sentiment
of a set of tweets, as twitter is a hub of mixed sentiments. To do this, the model was trained on a [Twitter](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data) dataset, consisting of the entirety of the text from a tweet, and sentiment of the
tweet. Using a BERT model, we were able to
achieve a precision and recall of roughly 80%.
